# This installs and configures i2b2 1.7 in Docker.
# Made by Sebastian Mate (sebastian.mate@fau.de) as part of the Dockerbank TMF project in June 2016

# Please note that this project may be outdated in terms of the i2b2 version. It can easily be upgrade to the latest version with the i2b2 Wizard from: https://github.com/sebmate/i2b2Wizard


# Install and run a Oracle-XE container, e.g.:

docker pull wnameless/oracle-xe-11g

docker run -d --name oracle -p 49160:22 -p 49161:1521 wnameless/oracle-xe-11g

# Build the i2b2 image based on the Dockerfile:

docker build -t cyberseb/i2b2:1.7.07 .

# Run the built i2b2 image as container:

docker run --name i2b2-1.7.07 -it -p 80:80 --link oracle:oracle cyberseb/i2b2:1.7.07 /bin/bash 

# In the running i2b2 container, start the i2b2-Wizard in automatic mode (for some reason, this cannot be done
# from the Dockerfile, because the dialog tool does not work):

./wizard.sh --docker oracle

# --------------------------------------

# To stop and remove all previously created containers, run these commands:

docker stop oracle
docker rm oracle

docker stop i2b2-1.7.07
docker rm i2b2-1.7.07

# To stop and remove ALL containers and images, run these commands (use with caution):

docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
